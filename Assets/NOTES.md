# Notes
## Scene
### Camera

- Move the "Regular camera" to change the view inside the editor
- You can set the zoom of the camera by changing the size (editor) and the values for camera zoom (in the camera controller)

## Tilemaps

- To create a smart tile, create a "Rule tile" and define how the tile should behave
- In the texture, make sure that you set the **Pixels per unit**
  - Set the texture to multiple if this is a set
  - You may change the filter mode (ex: Point)
  - You may change the max size (ex: 512)
  - You may change the compression (ex: none)
  - Apply
  - If this is a set, open the sprite editor and split the texture accordingly
